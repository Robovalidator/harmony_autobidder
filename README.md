# harmony_autobidder

## About

Harmony AutoBidder automatically manages BLS keys for your validator
to ensure you stay within a slot range while you sleep. It polls
for validator information regularly and decides to either remove or
add bls keys to stay within a slot range. The polling interval
starts slow and contracts as the end of the current epoch approaches.

If you've benefited from using this program please consider donating or delegating ONEs to RoboValidator at 
https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1x8fhymx4xsygy4dju9ea9vhs3vqg0u3ht0nz74 so we can continue
to improve this software.

## Download
### Install git
```
$ sudo apt install git
```

### Download harmony_autobidder repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Robovalidator/harmony_autobidder.git
```

## Setup
### Install requirements
```
$ cd harmony_autobidder
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the hmy client if you haven't already
```
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir ~/harmony
$ cd ~/harmony
$ curl -LO https://harmony.one/hmycli && mv hmycli hmy && chmod +x hmy
```
You don't have to use `~/harmony` but that's how the service is currently configured.
See `config.py` if you'd like to modify the path settings. Also make sure `$HOME/harmony` is 
in your system path.

### Create your passphrase.txt file
```
$ echo 'passphrase' > ~/harmony/passphrase.txt
$ chmod og-rw ~/harmony/passphrase.txt
```

### Copy BLS .key and .pass files into .hmy/allkeys
```
$ mkdir ~/harmony/.hmy/allkeys
$ cp ~/harmony/.hmy/blskeys/*.* ~/harmony/.hmy/allkeys
$ chmod og-rw ~/harmony/.hmy/allkeys/*.*
$ # Copy any other bls .key and .pass files from other nodes to ~/harmony/.hmy/allkeys as well
```

### Setup config.py 
1. If you are running a node on shard 0 on the same machine you can set
`USE_REMOTE_NODE = False` otherwise you need to set it to `True` since a lot of RPCs we use only work on shard 0.
2. Set `VALIDATOR_ADDR` to your validator's address
4. Configure `TARGET_SLOT` to your liking. The bot will try to adjust the keys in a way that puts you just at or above `TARGET_SLOT`.
5. If `PREVENT_INEFFICIENT_BID` is set to True the bot will try it's hardest to never overbid while keeping you elected.   
6. `MAX_VALIDATORS_PAGES` is the maximum number of validator pages the client can scan for downloading validator info
7. You still need to make sure your nodes are setup to run with all the BLS keys assigned to the validator between epoch changes

### Update bls_keys.py
1. Update `BLS_KEYS` to contain all your bls key string in order of highest priority. The keys will be added and removed as if this list was a stack.
```
BLS_KEYS = (
    "f82d30adadabaaaeba00406a5d607134343888dccf4fc45bdc22f02ad10df3ddeed1656a2a253262dae92095297e3f84", 
    "8be0121e5282071287886b07af678eefb67737f12d306c370f588d2612bf3020f9dc97fce63ee86c0ee3cd2153e43f90", 
    "2bcee590cb191a7bff14641fb0afdd6e07ee83b45e7247fce9dcf0fc10d8c7c3560dad54891cdf8bffff36e4a2c24f04", 
    "1c1d7ca4562ddda2cb456a766f86f487ff30bf2d3cbb692f359a29438b04cb6b79daf9241c44b514893076a14bea9984",  
)
```
2. The bls_keys.py file was separated out in order to avoid merge conflicts. If you want to do development 
you can run the following command so git will not track changes to the file.
```
git update-index --skip-worktree bls_keys.py
```

### vStatsBot Integration By Fortune Validator
Add your vStatsBot token acquired by running /token command on the bot to the autobidder config.py file. 
Set the two variables to True or False ( VSTATS_ALERT_REMOVE_KEY, VSTATS_ALERT_OUT_OF_ELECTION)

### Create a tmux session
```
$ tmux new-session -s autobidder
```
